                <p>M.C.E. Society’s M. A. Rangoonwala College of Dental Sciences and Research center, Pune is dedicated to the cherished memory of Mr. Mohammed Ali Rangoonwala, a great social worker and philanthropist. M. A. Rangoonwala had a passion for social work and education for the masses. In all his philanthropic organizations, his motto has always been “Service to Humanity”.

Based in Pune, he has come a long way and the journey has been possible only because he invested his best in everything he believed would enhance the education system, society and consequently contribute positively to the growth of our country. The foundation stone of our college was laid on 21st November 1998 at the hands of Mrs. Banobai Rangoonwala and Mr. Asif Rangoonwala.

The college started an undergraduate BDS course in the year 2001 and a postgraduate MDS course across 8 subjects in the year 0000 and has come a long way since then. The college has international certification courses in maxillofacial prosthodontics and diploma courses in dental lasers and endodontics in collaboration with the international universities. The college has numerous research projects and publications to its credit. The students have been securing university ranks
                    every year and have shown equal enthusiasm for extracurricular activities and sports. Also, nothing makes us prouder than the success of our Alumni. Rangoonwala students have a history of achieving their dreams and soaring beyond boundaries. We will continue to work relentlessly towards our goal to lead and transform the way dentistry is taught and practiced. We are moving ahead in our mission to serve the community and give back to society by making sure of complete professional grooming of our students so that they become better professionals and even better humans.</p>
